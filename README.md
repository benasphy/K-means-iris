**Report on Varying the K Value in K-Means Clustering**

Optimal K Value: The elbow method suggests that the optimal k value for the Iris dataset is 3. This is indicated by the elbow point in the plot of WCSS versus k. Model Performance: With k=3, the clustering model achieved an accuracy of 0.893 and a silhouette score of 0.66. These scores suggest that the model performs well in grouping the data points into distinct clusters.
Varying the k value in k-means clustering significantly impacts the performance and interpretability of the model.
